**Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews (NLTK + Python)
**
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn.

🚀 Features

Loads Amazon review dataset (20,000+ samples)

Preprocesses text using:

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lemmatization

Applies the preprocessing pipeline to clean review text

Trains and evaluates sentiment classification model

📂 Dataset

Amazon reviews dataset is loaded from PyCaret’s GitHub
.

It contains:

reviewText: customer review

Positive: sentiment label (1 = positive, 0 = negative)

🛠️ Preprocessing Steps

Tokenization – split reviews into words

Stopword Removal – remove common English words (e.g., the, and, is)

Lemmatization – reduce words to base form (running → run)

Rejoin Tokens – convert processed tokens back into a string

Classification Report
Class	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	Support
0 (Negative)	0.66	0.24	0.35	4767
1 (Positive)	0.80	0.96	0.87	15233

Overall Accuracy: 79%

Model performs well on positive reviews, but struggles with recall for negative reviews.

✅ This project builds a full pipeline from text preprocessing → feature extraction → sentiment classification → evaluation, and can be extended with advanced ML/DL models for better performance.
