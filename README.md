**Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews (NLTK + Python)**.
This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn.

**Features**.
Loads Amazon review dataset (20,000+ samples)
Preprocesses text using:
Tokenization
Stopword removal
Lemmatization
Applies the preprocessing pipeline to clean review text
Trains and evaluates sentiment classification model

**Dataset**.
Amazon reviews dataset is loaded from PyCaret‚Äôs GitHub.

It contains:
reviewText: customer review
Positive: sentiment label (1 = positive, 0 = negative)

**üõ†Ô∏è Preprocessing Steps**.

Tokenization ‚Äì split reviews into words
Stopword Removal ‚Äì remove common English words (e.g., the, and, is)
Lemmatization ‚Äì reduce words to base form (running ‚Üí run)
Rejoin Tokens ‚Äì convert processed tokens back into a string

**üìä Model Evaluation**.
Confusion Matrix
[[ 1131  3636]
 [  576 14657]]

**Classification Report**.
Class	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	Support
0 (Negative)	0.66	0.24	0.35	4767
1 (Positive)	0.80	0.96	0.87	15233

**Overall Accuracy: 79%**.
Model performs well on positive reviews, but struggles with recall for negative reviews.

‚úÖ This project builds a full pipeline from text preprocessing ‚Üí feature extraction ‚Üí sentiment classification ‚Üí evaluation, and can be extended with advanced ML/DL models for better performance.
